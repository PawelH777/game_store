# Installation on a local machine

In order to be able to use the created application Game Store on a local machine, the system needs to be prepared by downloading the necessary tools, installing them, clone microservices repo, compiling microservices and launching.

It will be presented in this section of the documentation.

## 1. Preparation of the necessary tools

First, prepare your environment. The application needs JDK with version 18 of Java, MongoDB database, Message Broker RabbitMQ

### 1.1 Download and install Open JDK 18

From the https://jdk.java.net/18/ page, download OpenJDK 18 and install according to the instructions provided

### 1.2. Download and install MongoDB

MongoDB is the database for the Orders and Carts microservice. Just download it from the website https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/ and install according to the instructions. While the application is running, the MongoDB service must be running. The application will automatically configure itself and start operating on the set database.

### 1.3. Download and install RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is needed to ensure communication between the Edit and View microservices. To use it, you must first install Erlang in administrator mode and RabbitMQ itself. Instructions can be found here - https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html

## 2. Clone microservices repositories

After installing the necessary tools in step 1, you can proceed to unpacking the microservice code (if you received it in zip) or clone the repository that stores it

In the second case, the matter is very simple. Just use the following command in git bash.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PawelH777/game_store.git`

This repository has separate repositories in which the microservice code is located. Separate repositories are managed as sub modules (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

## 3. Compile the code

Due to the number of microservices, this step may be a bit time-consuming. This inconvenience will be corrected in the future.

In order to run the application, compile the code of all microservices, i.e. Gateway, EurekaServer, Edit, View, Carts, Orders, Users. This can be done using the terminal and the command:

`mvn clean install`

You can also set up the project in Intellij and deploy "Reload All Projects" from Maven Sidebar. In this case, ignore the potential Eureka microservice synchronization error. It does not affect the operation of the application and probably affects the only local machine where it was found.

## 4. Run the application

In this case, I recommend using an IDE, preferably Intellij.

First, install the _Multirun_ plugin in Intellij. Intellij must be restarted after this.

Run configurations files have been placed in the .run folder. Just follow the instructions in https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html#share-configurations to import them.

After doing these steps, just run "Run microservices" rfom Run / Edit Configurations. This will start all microservices and after a short time you will be able to make requests to the API Gateway
