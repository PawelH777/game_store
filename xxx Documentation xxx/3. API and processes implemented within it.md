# API

As part of this project, the **Gateway** microservice was introduced, the purpose of which is to provide API for communication with the application. It is available on port 9671, i.e. if application is deployed locally, the way to communicate with it will be URI http://localhost:9671/{resource_name}

Each microservice also provides its API, which is currently available to an outsider, but ultimately it will be hidden. The URI to each of them after the domain part consists only of _/api_. This type of convention has been implemented with the idea that microservices do not need to indicate what resource will be processed, as each microservice has only one resource

Gateway supports the following paths to other microservices:

- http://localhost:9671/edit - Edit 
- http://localhost:9671/view - View
- http://localhost:9671/carts - Carts
- http://localhost:9671/orders - Orders
- http://localhost:9671/users  - Users

## Edit API

As part of the Edit microservice, the following API is made available by Gateway.

### POST http://localhost:9671/edit/api

#### Description

Endpoint for creating new games in the application. Such a game is created with the UNPUBLISHED status. It is not made available to the View microservice, therefore information about it is only available in the Edit microservice database.

#### Request

The request must consist of the following fields in the Request Body:

- name
- genre
- price

```
{
    "name": "test",
    "genre": "test",
    "price": 100.00
}
```

#### Response

In response, the **id** of the created game is sent.

### PUT http://localhost:9671/edit/api/{id}

#### Description

Endpoint for modifying created games. The game status cannot be changed within it. The changes are also not automatically made available to the View microservice. The entity in the Edit database will be given MODIFIED status, and the View database will still have the old version of the entity until the changes are published.

#### Request

The game id must be set under the _{id}_ in the URI.

The request must consist of the following fields in the Request Body:

#### Description

Endpoint to change game status. The game can take three statuses:

- PUBLISHED

In the event of a change to PUBLISHED, the game is made available via RabbitMQ to the View microservice, from where it can be retrieved via View endpoints.
 
In the event of a change to UNPUBLISHED, a message is sent to the View microservice, which, after processing, unpublishes the game after which is no longer available through the API in View.

#### Request

The game id must be set under the _{id}_ in the URI.

The request must consist of the following fields in the Request Body:

- gameStatus (only "published", "modified" and "unpublished" values are accepted)
