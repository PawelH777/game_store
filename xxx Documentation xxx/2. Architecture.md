# Architecture

It was decided that the architecture within which the application will be implemented is microservices with API Gateway.
The reasons for this decision are as follows:

- microservices can be scaled individually depending on the load, so that the application can better cope with the load,
- each created microservice can, independently of others, start using a different technological stack or database, depending on the current needs,
- a restrictive division based on the domain that naturally divides people into teams and protects against side-effects,
- when the business logic increases over time and becomes more complicated, it will be easier to find your way in logically separated microservices (projects).

Additionally, it was decided to store microservices in separate repositories. This way, hidden dependencies are not created through shared code. The code may also be appropriately encapsulated, for example, members of one team may be blocked from accessing the code of the other if the need arises. Another advantage of this approach is that when the project grows, the team will not have to manage their microservice in the IDE heavily loaded by the code of other microservices.

However, now references of all the repositories of all microservices have been put into one repository to simplify writing the basics of the application and testing it.

## Microservices

The architecture of the Game Store application is based on microservices and their databases. Efforts have been made to ensure that these components are as decoupled as possible now at this implementation stage.

### Gateway

The Gateway microservice acts as a router, load balancer and ultimately is to hide the internal API of other microservices from Clients by making its public API available. 

Services are discovered through the Service Registry Eureka located in a separate microservice called Eureka. Thanks to this, the load balancer is implemented out of the box, and in routes you do not need to enter the exact path to the service. 

As part of the Gateway microservice, the JWT Filter has been implemented, which is to block requests to secured endpoints such as _/orders_ by requiring the authenticating user token. A way to expire tokens has not been implemented. In the case of JWT tokens, it is standard for this activity to take place on the side of the Front-end

### Eureka (EurekaServer)

Eureka is an implementation of the [Service Discovery pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/service-discovery-microservices). 

This microservice functions as a Service Registry - it registers microservices that inform it about its existence, keeps the registry as up-to-date as possible and makes the registry available to other entities, such as the Gateway microservice.

Additionally, it simplifies communication between microservices. By using the Feign Clients functionality contained in its libraries, requests can be performed in a simplified way without specifying urls (the addressee is determined based on the mentioned service registry).

### Edit (EditGames)

The Edit microservice is a microservice whose main purpose is to save or modify data about games.

It is part of the implementation of the [CQRS pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/cqrs-event-sourcing-java), which it carries out together with the View microservice. For this reason, the only actions that can be performed using this microservice are saving, modifying or deleting games. Data reading takes place in the View microservice. Communication between these microservices takes place via Message Broker RabbitMQ.

A separate H2 relational database in memory mode was used for data storage.

### View (Read / ViewGames)

The View microservice (marked as Read in the diagram and listed in the project as the ViewGames submodule) is responsible for reading data about games.

As mentioned in the **Edit (EditGames)** section, it is part of the CQRS pattern implementation. The only operations that can be performed through this microservice is reading information about games from the database. The segregated database is maintained by messages sent from Edit via RabbitMQ.

### Carts (CartManagement)

The Cart microservice (CartManagement sub-module) was created to support carts, i.e. read, create, modify and delete them. The MongoDB database is used to store information about them. Using the Service Registry Eureka, the necessary information about the games (including their price) is retrieved from the View microservice.

As part of this microservice, the logic for calculating the total price of the basket has been implemented, and a validation has also been introduced that only one copy of the game can be added to the basket (a popular solution in online stores with games like Steam, GOG).

### Orders (OrderManagement)

The main and only task of the Orders microservice is order management.

It accepts requests to create, modify or read the order and if it passes through the authentication implemented in the Gateway microservice, it is processed. In some cases, it needs data from another microservice and in this case it communicates with it via Eureka, e.g. to retrieve precise data about the Cart.

This microservice has an additional JWT token authentication in the event of a request directly to the microservice.

### Users

The Users microservice is used to register new users and log them in.

Registration is done by sending a request with a username and password, which are stored in the database. This data is needed for validation at user login. If the user has sent correct data -> the JWT token is created and send to Client in the response.

## Architecture used in microservices

In the case of Gateway and Eureka microservices, there is no exact architecture in these projects. There is little code written, so it is kept in the main package.

In the case of other microservices, they were written in accordance with the principles of hexagonal architecture. The architecture presented in the following article was the inspiration -> https://www.baeldung.com/hexagonal-architecture-ddd-spring

It is similar to the [Onion architecture](https://blog.allegro.tech/2020/05/hexagonal-architecture-by-example.html).

The main idea behind this approach is to divide the code into 3 separate parts:

- Application
- Domain
- Infrastructure

### Application

Application layer. As part of it, code is implemented that deals with the exposure of data and related processes to the outside world, i.e. other microservices or clients.

This layer includes implementations of Rest or other types controllers.

As part of this project, attempts were made to create a model based on objects with a suffix _Request, _Response, _DTO (from Data Transfer Objects)

### Domain

Domain layer. Implements business logic. It is the heart of the application. One of the principles of hexagonal architecture is to implement classes within this layer as POJO, i.e. without the use of Spring or Hibernate frameworks. Thanks to this approach, it is easy to change the type of database or even the framework that manages the application. Additionally, it makes testing such code simple.

The convention is to name objects in the domain with the suffix _DO (from Domain Object)

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure layer. As part of it, code for communication with the database and data consumption from other sources, e.g. other microservices, is implemented.

There is a convention for naming model objects without any prefix, as they are usually database entities.
